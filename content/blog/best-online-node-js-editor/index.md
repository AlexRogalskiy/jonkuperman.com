Online node js editors have come a long way in the last few years! A few years ago, I would have recommended against using an online editor. I would have said you should install Node js locally instead. But that's no longer true.

Out of all the node js editors, there are two clear standouts.

## Replit

### Replit is:

> A free, collaborative, in-browser IDE to code in 50+ languages â€” without spending a second on setup.

[Replit](https://repl.it/) is my go-to for any online server-side language editor. The interface is clean, the UI is snappy, and it supports so many languages. The online node js support is top-notch, and you can easily collaborate with friends! You can even deploy your node js app via Replit and share it with the world!

## CodeSandbox

### CodeSandBox is:

> Where teams build faster, together. Create, share, and get feedback with collaborative sandboxes for rapid web development.

I still remember what a gamechanger it was when [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) came on the scene. It allows you to instantly create React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, and Vanilla JS apps.

You can add [npm](npmjs.com) packages (even private ones). You can whip up a React project with all your actual dependencies and share an idea with the world!

They also have great support for node js editing. Quickly create a Node js HTTP server and share it with friends or use it for a demo!

## Which online editor is best?

If I had to choose, I'd say the best currently online node js editor is Replit. It's free, fast, and accessible. You can build or prototype anything you want and easily share it. Plus it offers support for so many languages.

Some other apps offer a Node js repl, but none have the quality or accessibility of Replit and CodeSandbox.
