Introduction to cryptocurrencies

I recently went down a bit of a crypto rabbit hole. I've been aware of Bitcoin since 2014, but I didn't truly understand it, and I had no idea about all the newer things in the space. Some questions I had when starting:

---

1. What are exchanges?
1. What is a wallet?
1. What is mining?
1. Are all cryptocurrencies terrible for the environment?
1. How do taxes on crypto work?
1. What is a DAO?
1. What is the deal with NFTs?

## How I got started

First things first, I watched a few free documentaries on the history of Bitcoin.

### Crypto Documentaries I Watched

### First up, Banking on Bitcoin

Free on YouTube, Banking on Bitcoin makes a great introduction. It starts with the 2008 financial crisis and follows along with Bitcoin's creation and early history.

### Next, Cryptopia

Free with an Amazon Prime subscription, [Cryptopia](https://www.amazon.com/Cryptopia-Bitcoin-Blockchains-Future-Internet/dp/B08HSLGR29) covers the good, the bad and the ugly of crypto.

### Short and sweet, Netflix Explained: Cryptocurrency

Season 1 of [Netflix Explained](https://www.netflix.com/title/80216752) has a "Cryptocurrency" episode that is very good! It's only 19 minutes long, but it covers a lot.
