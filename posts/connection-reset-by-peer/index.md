This tutorial is meant to help troubleshoot **connection reset by peer** issues you might have while using SSH.

Ever tried to SSH into your server and seen an error like this?

```bash
ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer
```

The first thing you should always do if SSH fails is try again with verbose logging on. Just try something like this:

```bash
ssh username@address.com -vv
```

If the problem is on your clientâ€™s side, some sort of error should show up in that log. If you arenâ€™t seeing anything useful in there, the problem may be with your server.

## The Tricky Part

So, how do you get on your server if you cant ssh!?

If youâ€™re lucky, your host will provide you with some sort of shell access via their web UI. If not, they should at least offer some alternative method for access. That part youâ€™ll need to figure out for yourself.

## After You Get Access

If you want to see everything that SSH is doing on the server side, hereâ€™s what you can try ( assuming Debian or Ubuntu here ):

```bash
sudo service ssh stop
sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -d
```

That will show you a real time log of everything that happens to SSH. If, as I suspect, you are banned from your server ( fail2ban or some other program has put your IP in /etc/hosts.deny ) you should see something like this in the log:

```bash
debug1: Connection refused by tcp wrapper
```

It could mean a number of things, but very likely youâ€™re being blocked by hosts.deny. The simplest way to test would be to put an allow all in hosts.allow

```bash
vi /etc/hosts.allow
```

and put in something like:

```bash
sshd: ALL
```

Then try re-connecting. If that was your problem, try re-configuring fail2ban or whatever you have on your server that is sticking IPs into hosts.deny. If not, keep Googling! ðŸ˜‰
