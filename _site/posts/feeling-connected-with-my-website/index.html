<p>I've been using <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby</a> on my site for ages. I enjoy using it. It's pretty easy to get up and running with, it loads quickly, and it comes with some great plugins like this one for <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/working-with-images/">optimizing images</a>. It deploys easily and has all the benefits of a static site (you don't have to worry about maintaining your own databases or servers). The thing is, though, there's a lot to it.</p>
<!-- excerpt -->
<p>There's no way of avoiding having to use React, Helmet, GraphQL, a complicated build system, tons of plugins, etc. After a fair amount of time, I started feeling pretty disconnected from the HTML/CSS I was trying to produce on my blog.</p>
<p>I'd heard a ton of great stuff about <a href="https://www.11ty.io">11ty</a>, a new static site generator that's supposed to be very simple to use. So I figured I'd give it a try. I moved my site over pretty quickly using their <a href="https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog">base blog repo</a>, and so far, it feels great being a little &quot;closer to the wire&quot; to my content.</p>
<p>We'll see how it goes.</p>
